# escalator-classification
### The most crucial priority of airports is overall safety of their passengers. However, a common problem arising at airports is the risk of passengers taking dangerous objects with them on escalators. These objects consist of things such as large luggage, strollers, and wheelchairs. Currently, there is no effective means of warning passengers that they are carrying a potentially dangerous object onto the escalator, therefore there is no way to mitigate this danger. It would be inefficient and unnecessary to have an airport worker stay guard to warn any escalator onboarders. It would also likely be ineffective to simply post a sign listing prohibited objects. Due to this, a method that is efficient and can still effectively mitigate this danger can be achieved through automation.
### As a machine learning team at the Port of Seattle, Adrian Avram, Abigail Batinga, Ivy Zhou and Faziah Zuberi worked on employing and assessing various machine learning models, seeking to discover the most accurate models for detecting a potentially dangerous situation on airport escalators.
### This is Ivy Zhou's approach in using transfer learning to build a binary classifier.
